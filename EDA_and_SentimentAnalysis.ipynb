      "The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\n",
      "any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\n",
      "the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\n",
      "all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\n",
      "loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\n",
      "that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\n",
      "is reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\n",
      "full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\n",
      "the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\n",
      "non-recourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\n",
      "The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\n",
      "architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\n",
      "organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\n",
      "many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\n",

      "EARLY LAND COSTS\n",
      "The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\n",
      "represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\n",
      "extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\n",
      "probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\n",
      "price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\n",

      "completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\n",
      "expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\n",
      "improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\n",
      "irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\n",

      "spent no interest is charged on these funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\n",
      "finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\n",
      "high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\n",
      "per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n",
      "$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\n",
      "which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\n",
      "obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\n",
      "provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\n",

      "landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\n",

      "estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\n",
      "loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\n",

      "in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\n",
      "construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\n",
      "difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n",
      "\n",

      "DISBURSEMENTS\n",
      "Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\n",
      "near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\n",
      "payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\n",
      "will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\n",
      "fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n",
      "15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\n",
      "These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\n",

      "to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\n",
      "cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\n",
      "function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\n",
      "from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\n",
      "Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\n",
      "used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\n",
